                <h1>Dear Breebrees</h1>
                <p>
                  I’ve been thinking a lot lately about us, about how far we’ve come. It’s been a year of late night calls, laughs, misunderstandings, waiting, missing each other, and still choosing to stay. And honestly? Even if it hasn’t always been perfect, I wouldn’t trade it for anything. I feel lucky that I get to build something with you, even from a distance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I know I stumble sometimes. There are moments where I get busy, moments I don’t multitask well, and I know that makes you feel like you’re not giving my all. The truth is, I don’t want you to ever feel like you’re not important because you are, you always are. But sometimes I get tired, and I need a little downtime or space to breathe. Not because I’m pulling away, but because I want to recharge so I can love you better.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I realize love isn’t about controlling each other or setting rules on what we can or can’t do. Love is trust, freedom, and choosing each other no matter what. I don’t want us to feel like we’re against one another when things get tough. I don’t want you to feel like I’m shutting you out when I ask for balance. What I really want is for us to fight for this relationship, side by side.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sometimes I might not get it right. I might say things wrong, I might get upset, I might not respond in the perfect way. But what I promise is that I’ll always try to make things right with you. I’ll always come back, I’ll always choose you, even after misunderstandings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This distance we’re in is hard we both know that. But even with the challenges, I still find myself falling for you more every day. Every call, every laugh, every little moment we share is proof to me that what we have is real. And I don’t want to lose that.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You’re my peace, my safe place, my person. Even when we clash, I never forget how much I love you. I hope we can keep learning how to understand each other better — not by controlling, but by respecting and trusting. By knowing that even when I take a step back to breathe, my heart is still right here with you.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I want this long-term. I want us to keep choosing each other despite the hard days. You’re worth it, love. You’ve always been worth it.
                </p>
